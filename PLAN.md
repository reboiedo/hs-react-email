# Harbour.Space Email Templates - Project Plan

## ✅ Project Status: COMPLETED

This project has successfully implemented a production-ready email template system for Harbour.Space University.

## 🎯 What We Built

### 🏗️ Core System
- **Design Token System**: Centralized colors, typography, and spacing based on official Harbour.Space brand guidelines
- **Component Library**: Reusable email components (HSLayout, HSButton, HSEmailHeader, HSEmailFooter)
- **Template System**: Dynamic, responsive email templates with prop-based customization
- **Asset Management**: Cloudinary CDN integration with automatic optimization for email delivery
- **Email Integration**: SendGrid API integration with React Email server-side rendering

### 📧 Email Templates
- **Event Confirmation**: Complete responsive template with dynamic event details, location handling, and call-to-action buttons

### 🎨 Design System Features
- **Brand Consistency**: Official Harbour.Space purple (#4B2696) used throughout
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized layouts that work across all email clients
- **Typography**: Inter font family with consistent sizing (24px for key headings, etc.)
- **Component Variants**: Primary/secondary/outline button styles, flexible layout options
